    <h1>ES6 Promises</h1>
    <p>An alternative for callbacks!</p>
    <p>
      They called Promise because while they're doing asynchronous operation
      they can <strong>Promise</strong> to do something when that operation is
      finished
    </p>
    <p>
      We can handle a promise response with a <strong>.then</strong> inside
      there is what we'll do when the promise is complete
    </p>
